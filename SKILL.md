## Covey's Emotional Bank Account Framework

The Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor for the amount of trust in a relationship. Like a financial account, you make deposits and withdrawals. When trust is high, communication is easy. When the account is overdrawn, every interaction becomes difficult.

### The Core Principle

"If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank Account with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, and keeping my commitments to you, I build up a reserve. Your trust toward me becomes higher, and I can call upon that trust many times if I need to."

### The Six Major Deposits

| Deposit | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Understanding the Individual** | Taking time to understand what matters to them | Learning their goals, fears, preferences |
| **Attending to Little Things** | Small kindnesses and courtesies | Remembering details, saying thank you |
| **Keeping Commitments** | Doing what you said you would do | Following through on promises |
| **Clarifying Expectations** | Being explicit about what you need and expect | Not assuming they should "just know" |
| **Showing Personal Integrity** | Being loyal to those not present | Not gossiping; defending them when absent |
| **Apologizing Sincerely** | Making a genuine apology when you withdraw | Not defending, explaining, or minimizing |

### Common Withdrawals

| Withdrawal | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Disrespect** | Treating them as less than; rudeness |
| **Breaking promises** | Not doing what you said |
| **Betraying confidences** | Sharing what was told in trust |
| **Unclear expectations** | Setting them up for failure through ambiguity |
| **Duplicity** | Being two-faced; saying one thing to them, another to others |
| **Pride** | Refusing to apologize when clearly wrong |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Account Assessment

Diagnose the current state of the account:
- Is the account in surplus (high trust), balanced, or overdrawn?
- What withdrawals have occurred (by you or circumstances)?
- What deposits have been made recently?
- What is the pattern over time?

### Step 2: Withdrawal Analysis

Identify the specific withdrawals that have damaged trust:
- Were commitments broken?
- Were expectations unclear?
- Was there disrespect, even unintentional?
- Were confidences betrayed?
- Was there duplicity or two-faced behavior?

**Critical insight:** Sometimes your intention doesn't match their experience. What feels like a small thing to you may be a large withdrawal for them.

### Step 3: Deposit Planning

Design specific deposits based on what matters TO THEM (not what would matter to you):

**Understanding deposits:**
- What do you need to learn about their world?
- What questions should you ask?
- What should you observe?

**Little things deposits:**
- What small kindnesses would mean the most to them?
- What do they value that you could acknowledge?

**Commitment deposits:**
- What commitments can you make and KEEP?
- Better to under-promise and over-deliver

**Clarification deposits:**
- What expectations need to be made explicit?
- What assumptions need to be tested?

**Integrity deposits:**
- How can you demonstrate loyalty?
- What can you say about them to others?

**Apology deposits (if needed):**
- What do you need to sincerely apologize for?
- Without explanation, justification, or minimization?

### Step 4: Implementation Sequence

Plan the order and timing:
- Quick wins that demonstrate change
- Sustained deposits over time
- Avoid deposit "flooding" (feels manipulative)
- Build gradually and consistently

## Constraints

- Deposits must be genuine, not manipulative techniques
- What counts as a deposit depends on THEIR values, not yours
- You cannot make deposits faster than trust can grow
- Some accounts may be overdrawn beyond repair — recognize when to accept this
- Apologies without behavior change are withdrawals, not deposits
- Understanding the individual is the foundation — without it, other deposits may miss

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My relationship with my teenage daughter is terrible. We used to be so close, but now she barely talks to me. When she does, we end up arguing. I feel like I've lost her."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Emotional Bank Account Assessment

### The Relationship
**With:** Teenage daughter
**Current State:** Minimal communication, frequent conflict, emotional distance
**Account Status:** Overdrawn

### Withdrawal Analysis

**Identified Withdrawals:**
| Withdrawal Type | What Happened | Impact Level |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Unclear expectations** | Rules that feel arbitrary to her; "because I said so" | High |
| **Not understanding** | Giving advice when she wants to be heard | High |
| **Broken implicit commitments** | Being too busy when she reached out in the past | Medium |
| **Disrespect (perceived)** | Dismissing her feelings as "just teenage stuff" | High |
| **Lectures instead of listening** | Turning conversations into teaching moments | Medium |

**Pattern Recognition:**
The pattern suggests a shift from connection-based parenting (when she was younger) to control-based parenting (as she seeks independence). Each attempt to guide feels like a withdrawal to her because she doesn't feel understood first.

**Her Perspective:**
From her view, you may have become someone who:
- Talks AT her rather than WITH her
- Doesn't take her feelings seriously
- Wants to control rather than connect
- Has forgotten what it felt like to be her age
- Loves the child she was, not the person she's becoming

Even if this isn't your intention, this may be her experience.

### Deposit Prescription

**Immediate Deposits (This Week):**
| Deposit Type | Specific Action | Why This Matters to Her |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Understanding** | Ask about something she cares about (music, friends, interests) with genuine curiosity, not judgment | Shows you see her as a person, not a problem |
| **Little things** | Leave a note that says "I love you" — no lecture attached | Affirmation without conditions |
| **Clarifying expectations** | Ask "What do you need from me right now?" before giving advice | Treats her as an expert on her own life |

**Sustained Deposits (Ongoing):**
| Deposit Type | Specific Action | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Understanding** | Listen without fixing. Let her talk and reflect back what you hear. | Every conversation |
| **Keeping commitments** | If you say you'll be there, be there. If you commit to not lecturing, don't lecture. | Always |
| **Attending to little things** | Remember what she tells you and follow up | Weekly |
| **Showing integrity** | Speak positively about her to others (she may hear) | Ongoing |

**If Apology Needed:**
What to say: "I realize I haven't been listening to you the way you need. I've been so focused on guiding you that I forgot to first understand you. I'm sorry. I want to do better."

What NOT to say: "I'm sorry IF you felt..." (not an apology), "I was just trying to help" (defense), "When I was your age..." (lecture in disguise)

### Account Rebuilding Timeline

**Week 1:** Focus on ONE successful interaction where you listen more than talk. Don't try to fix anything. Success = she felt heard.

**Month 1:** Aim for at least three interactions where she initiates conversation with you. This signals the account is building.

**Ongoing:** Maintain deposits even when things improve. The teenage years are a long withdrawal period developmentally — steady deposits matter more than dramatic gestures.

### Warning Signs

Watch for these indicators the account is being depleted again:
- She stops making eye contact
- Responses become one-word answers
- She stops telling you things she used to share
- You find yourself in the same argument pattern

### The Covey Principle

"Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply."

Your daughter needs psychological air. She needs to feel understood before she can be open to understanding. Every lecture, every piece of advice, every "when I was your age" is a withdrawal because it communicates: your job is to listen to me, not for me to understand you.

The hardest part? She may not immediately respond to deposits. Overdrawn accounts take time to rebuild. But consistent, genuine deposits — especially understanding and listening — will eventually create space for connection.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Stephen Covey** expert persona. It provides the diagnostic framework for trust in relationships, which is foundational to the Public Victory habits (4-6). Use it when relationships are strained, before negotiations (win-win-agreement), or when communication has broken down (empathic-listening).
